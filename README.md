# Adentu: An hybrid molecular dynamic software

This is Adentu, an hybrid molecular dynamic software, aim to simulate
interactions between a fluid like the air with solid grains.

It's an hybrid molecular dynamic software because it uses the Event Drive
Molecular Dynamic and Multiple Particle Collision aproaches to simulate hard
spheres and fluids respectively.

** Adentu is in alpha stage, do not spect to get full working simulations! **
